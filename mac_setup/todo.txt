Had to su in an admin user, which may have aused issues

Had to set
sudo chmod 755 Makefile
to be able to do anything

homebrew install was busted. The resulting entry in .zprofile is 'eval ""'
Also went into the admin's zprofile instead, since I was su into that user
Then I don't have brew in my path so can't install anything etc.
 So need to fix this not resolving properly
 	(echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> /Users/${USER}/.zprofile
	eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

 Probably want to switch to zsh immediately, as in before brew, so I'm installig via that shell

 for gem install, got
 ERROR: SSL verification error at depth 2: unable to get local issuer certificate (20)
 ERROR: You must add /O=Cisco/CN=Cisco Umbrella Root CA to your local trusted store

Wrote in a user variable, and switched zsh install to use that user insteal

Having a separate admin account is awful

Need to manually let krabiner do things in privacy and security by entering password
